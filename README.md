#  Data Analysis with R

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a student dataset using various statistical techniques in R. The dataset includes information about students' academic performance (e.g., GPA, test scores) and demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, grade level). The project focuses on applying statistical methods to explore the relationships between different student attributes and their academic outcomes.

### **Key Techniques Used**:
- Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots)
- Probability & Distributions
- Sampling & Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Chi-Square Tests for categorical data
- Correlation and Regression Analysis

## Steps Involved

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating basic statistics (mean, median, SD) for variables like GPA and test scores.
2. **Data Visualization**: Creating basic plots to explore data distribution, correlations, and patterns.
3. **Probability & Distributions**: Estimating probabilities and analyzing distributions of key variables.
4. **Sampling & Confidence Intervals**: Using sampling techniques to estimate confidence intervals for means.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting t-tests and ANOVA to test hypotheses about group differences.
6. **Chi-Square Test**: Performing chi-square tests to examine relationships between categorical variables.
7. **Regression Analysis**: Building regression models to understand the relationships between variables.
